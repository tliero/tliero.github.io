First custom Bootstrap compile (with http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-plugin-less on Ubuntu)
--> custom.bootstrap.less has to be opened, when running the run configuration!
Run configuration:
  LESS command: lessc
  [X] Strict imports
  [X] Compress the generated CSS file
  Input file: /tliero/less/custom.bootstrap.less
  Output file: /tliero/bootstrap-custom/css/custom.bootstrap.css 

On Windows setup for use with eclipse LESS builder https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-less, see .settings/com.palantir.less.prefs
